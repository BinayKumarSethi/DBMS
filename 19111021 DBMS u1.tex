 \section{Introduction}
 
Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) have a high number of players that can interact with one another at any time. One possibility is that each shard is a separate world that is placed on a server. Another option is to make the shard support a set number of concurrent players on a full universe or playing field. Other games may have a single universe that is partitioned and distributed over multiple servers. Players who log into one server will be in that server's universe; to access another section of the game universe, they must switch servers.
MMOGs are data-driven applications, and the databases that power them must meet high performance, availability and scalability.

In this report we will be discussing the importance of databases for the gaming industry, what its requirements are in terms of database technology as well as a discussion on why MySQL is or should be the database of choice for anyone wanting to develop online social games that are reliable and stable in all their aspects.
